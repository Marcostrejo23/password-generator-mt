# password-generator-mt

In this applicaiton, I used Javascript to create a simple password generator. The Generator takes in if the user wants lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. When the user clicks the generate password button, they will be presented with prompts, and then returned a password based on the parameters they selected.
